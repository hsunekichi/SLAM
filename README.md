# SLAM Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains the laboratory assignments for the **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** course in the MRGCV master's program at the University of Zaragoza (Unizar).

## Course Overview

The objective of the SLAM course is to study the main techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping, understand their mathematical and algorithmic foundations, and apply them to real-world examples.

### Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Understand the different types of localization and mapping systems.
- Comprehend key perception algorithms for tracking and place recognition.
- Operate and calibrate standard sensors for localization and mapping.
- Design and develop SLAM systems for various applications.
- Evaluate the performance of SLAM systems under realistic conditions.
- Propose and assess new algorithms to address unresolved challenges in SLAM systems.

## Course Syllabus

### Fundamentals
- Basic concepts, theory, and estimation methods.

### Robustness
